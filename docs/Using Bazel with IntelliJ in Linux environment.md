Building Thrift from source seems to give certain errors when tried on both Mac and Linux. On Linux, we can install the thrift compiler using the following command, which installs 0.9.1 version of thrift compiler on Mac.

> sudo apt-get install thrift-compiler

Also, we can setup the environment (which includes the thrift installation) by running the install_workstation.sh script on our local linux machine.

Once the environment has been setup, we can use IntelliJ IDE for our development and unit testing on our local machine.

Steps:-

1. Download the community version of IntelliJ.
2. Install the bazel plugin from within the IDE (**Settings > Plugins > Install > Browse Repositories, and search for 'Bazelâ€™**).
3. **Import Basel project > Select the existing Basel project > Select project view (.bazelproject file)** - Select the **Create from scratch option**.
4. The content of the `.bazelproject` file would be as below:
