# Submitting problem reports in github

Github issues are the CEDP's vehicle for reporting technical problems, describing requirements and posting questions.

Follow these tips to ensure your issues reach the right people and that the whole system works efficiently.

### Opener of issue closes the issue

Per convention, the person who opens an issue is responsible for closing the issue once the problem or request has been resolved. Promptly closing issues is important to keep the project working smoothly. If after an issue has been resolved a related issue arises, please close the first issue and open a new one for the follow-on matter.  Open issues which have been open without activity for an extremely long period of time may be closed by project admins eventually.
Use labels

### Use Labels
Labels allow you to express the technical category and give an issue a priority.  
By clicking on the "Labels" section in the upper right, any combination of labels can be scrolled through and clicked to add to the issue.
