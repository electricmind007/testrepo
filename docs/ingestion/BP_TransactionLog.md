# Transaction Log Overflow

On occasion ingestion may stop due to the transaction log being full. If this happens, first reduce the commit count used importing into the Drop Zone database. If the error persists, open a  [github issue](Community.md) and the CEDP specialists will work with you to find a solution. In all cases thus far, a simple adjustment of transaction log parameters, performed by CEDP support,  resolves the problem.
